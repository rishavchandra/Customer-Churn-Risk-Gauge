# Customer-Churn-Risk-Gauge
A web app which predicts and displays the risk score of customer churn, based on the feature input values given by the user.

<h2>What is Customer Churn?</h2>
The percentage of consumers that ceased using the goods or services offered by your company over a specific time period is known as customer churn. How many of your current clients are unlikely to make another purchase from your company is indicated by your customer turnover rate.

All organisations aim to steer clear of having a high churn rate. Your clients' dissatisfaction with your goods or services is shown by a high churn rate. Perhaps you're not marketing to the right groups of people. Or perhaps you don't consider what your customers have to say. If you see that your company has a high customer turnover rate, it's time to make some adjustments to enhance client retention and fast minimise your churn rate.

In here, a Random forest model was found to be the most accurate, and hence, it has been used in the final model building, wherein it predicts the customer churn risk score(on a scale of -1 to 5) depending on the values of the various features that the user gives as input.
